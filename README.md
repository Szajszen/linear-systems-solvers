# Linear Systems Solvers (Python)

A short project completed during the **Computer Science studies** for the **Numerical Methods** course.  
This project implements and compares multiple classic numerical methods for solving linear equation systems of the form **Ax = b**.

## About the Project

The goal was to implement three core algorithms — **Jacobi**, **Gauss-Seidel**, and **LU factorization** —  
without relying on matrix libraries. All matrix operations were implemented manually using plain Python lists.

The system analyzed is based on a custom band matrix of size 919×919, and results were validated through residual norms  
and performance comparison on increasingly large problems.
